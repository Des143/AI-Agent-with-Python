# Core Concepts of AI Agents

This document explains the fundamental concepts and components of AI agents.

## 1. Agent Architecture

### Perception Module
The perception module is responsible for:
- Receiving input from the environment
- Processing sensory data
- Converting raw data into meaningful information

Example:
```python
def perceive(self, environment_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    self.current_state = environment_state
    self.memory.append({
        'state': environment_state,
        'timestamp': np.datetime64('now')
    })
```

### Processing Module
The processing module:
- Analyzes perceived information
- Makes decisions based on current state
- Considers goals and constraints

Example:
```python
def process(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    decision = {
        'action': 'wait',
        'confidence': 0.0
    }
    
    if 'goal' in self.current_state:
        if self.current_state['goal'] == 'learn':
            decision['action'] = 'study'
            decision['confidence'] = 0.8
            
    return decision
```

### Action Module
The action module:
- Executes decisions
- Interacts with the environment
- Produces observable effects

Example:
```python
def act(self, decision: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    action = decision['action']
    confidence = decision['confidence']
    return f"Performed action: {action} with confidence: {confidence}"
```

### Learning Module
The learning module:
- Updates knowledge based on experience
- Improves decision-making over time
- Adapts to changing environments

Example:
```python
def learn(self, feedback: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    if 'success' in feedback:
        self.knowledge_base[feedback['context']] = {
            'action': feedback['action'],
            'success_rate': feedback['success']
        }
```

## 2. Types of Agents

### 1. Simple Reflex Agents
- React to current percepts
- No memory of past states
- Use condition-action rules

### 2. Model-Based Agents
- Maintain internal state
- Track aspects of the world
- Use model of how world evolves

### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Have specific goals
- Consider future actions
- Use planning to achieve goals

### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Have utility functions
- Make decisions based on expected utility
- Consider multiple goals

### 5. Learning Agents
- Improve performance over time
- Learn from experience
- Adapt to new situations

## 3. Environment Properties

### Fully Observable vs Partially Observable
- **Fully Observable**: Agent can see entire state
- **Partially Observable**: Agent can only see part of state

### Deterministic vs Stochastic
- **Deterministic**: Next state is completely determined by current state and action
- **Stochastic**: Next state has some randomness

### Episodic vs Sequential
- **Episodic**: Each episode is independent
- **Sequential**: Current decision affects future decisions

### Static vs Dynamic
- **Static**: Environment doesn't change while agent is thinking
- **Dynamic**: Environment can change while agent is thinking

### Discrete vs Continuous
- **Discrete**: Finite number of states and actions
- **Continuous**: Infinite number of states and actions

## 4. Decision Making

### Rule-Based Systems
```python
if condition:
    action = 'do_something'
else:
    action = 'do_something_else'
```

### Utility-Based Decisions
```python
def calculate_utility(state):
    return sum(weights * features)
```

### Planning
```python
def plan(goal, current_state):
    actions = []
    while not goal_achieved:
        action = choose_best_action()
        actions.append(action)
    return actions
```

## 5. Learning Mechanisms

### Supervised Learning
- Learn from labeled examples
- Predict outcomes based on input
- Example: Classification, Regression

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learn from rewards and punishments
- Maximize cumulative reward
- Example: Q-learning, Policy Gradients

### Unsupervised Learning
- Find patterns in data
- No explicit feedback
- Example: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

## 6. Memory and Knowledge

### Short-term Memory
- Temporary storage
- Current state information
- Recent experiences

### Long-term Memory
- Permanent storage
- Learned knowledge
- Past experiences

### Knowledge Representation
- Facts and rules
- Relationships
- Procedures

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Informative error messages
   - Recovery mechanisms

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for interactions
   - Performance testing

4. **Documentation**
   - Clear code comments
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples

5. **Performance**
   - Efficient algorithms
   - Resource management
   - Scalability considerations
