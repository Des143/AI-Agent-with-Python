# Getting Started with AI Agent Development

This guide will help you understand the basics of AI agent development and get you started with creating your own agents.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a software entity that:
- Perceives its environment through sensors
- Processes information to make decisions
- Takes actions to achieve goals
- Learns from experience

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Agent Architecture
An AI agent typically consists of:
- **Perception Module**: Receives and interprets input
- **Processing Module**: Makes decisions
- **Action Module**: Executes decisions
- **Learning Module**: Improves over time
- **Memory**: Stores experiences
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores learned information

### 2. Environment
The environment is everything the agent interacts with:
- **Observable**: What the agent can perceive
- **Dynamic**: Changes over time
- **Stochastic**: Contains uncertainty
- **Continuous/Discrete**: Time and state space

### 3. Actions
Actions are what the agent can do:
- **Discrete Actions**: Specific, separate actions
- **Continuous Actions**: Range of possible actions
- **Action Space**: All possible actions

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Project Structure
```
python-ai-agent-course/
├── src/            # Source code
├── tests/          # Test files
├── notebooks/      # Jupyter notebooks
├── docs/           # Documentation
└── data/           # Data files
```

## Your First Agent

Let's create a simple agent:

```python
from src.simple_agent import SimpleAIAgent

# Create an agent
agent = SimpleAIAgent(name="MyFirstAgent")

# Define environment state
environment = {
    'goal': 'learn',
    'resources': ['books', 'internet']
}

# Agent perceives environment
agent.perceive(environment)

# Agent makes decision
decision = agent.process()

# Agent takes action
result = agent.act(decision)

print(result)
```

## Next Steps

1. Explore the [Core Concepts](core_concepts.md) guide
2. Try the examples in the `notebooks` directory
3. Read the [Implementation Guide](implementation.md)
4. Check out [Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)

## Common Questions

### Q: What's the difference between an AI agent and a regular program?
A: AI agents are autonomous, can learn from experience, and make decisions based on their environment, while regular programs follow fixed instructions.

### Q: Do I need to know machine learning to create AI agents?
A: Not necessarily. You can start with rule-based agents and gradually incorporate machine learning as you progress.

### Q: How do I make my agent learn?
A: Start with the `learn()` method in the SimpleAIAgent class. You can implement various learning algorithms like reinforcement learning or supervised learning.
